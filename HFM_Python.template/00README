Direct interface to C++ from Python 3.*

This exemple should be performed where has been installed the HFM library

an easy	installation from anaconda, install python, pybind11
(often add numpy and matplotlib)

another way on an already env of conda

conda install -c conda-forge pybind11
=================

inside HamiltonFastMarching (where you have installed it),
go to Interfaces and then to PythonHFM

create a build directory
cd build
cmake ..
make

libraries should be created.

go to ExampleFiles and then to LibraryBased
create a directory HFMpy and copy inside it all previous libraries

Inside the directory LibraryBased
python IsotropicTest.py will show a very small example.

==================

Pros: avoid the IO burden
Cons: Python and pybind11 are needed aside C++
